# PokemonProject
PokemonProject is a java project for the University of Université Paris Est Marne La Vallée,
It's been created by two students : Maxime Rodriguez and Baptiste PERRIN

Its a graphical app based on the JavaFX library where you can play at Pokémon,
For compiling it, you just have to launch the Main.java in eclipse.

Our project (The Code) is actually under GNU General License, but all the Sprites, Musics and are owned by The Pokemon Company.

## Good To Know
### Knowns Bugs
1. Sometimes, when you launch a new game, the game can freeze, juste close it and relaunch it, we don't identified the source of the bug at the moment
2. The Program is destined to Linux Distro and has been tested for Debian (Debian/Ubuntu/Etc.), we can't promise that everything will work on a Windows OS

### Other Things
1. If the Project don't launch, you will need to configure your Java Build Path by adding the JavaFX libraries (already in the project)
